Short-term business loans have short repayment timelines, usually of 12 to 24 months. These loans are good for meeting immediate financial needs, such as operating expenses, inventory, payroll and other working capital needs. While it can take as little as a few hours to get a short-term loan with an online lender, banks can take days or even weeks to fund. Still, there are some advantages to sticking with a well-known bank.
